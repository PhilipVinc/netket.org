If you have a google, account, simply head to NetKet&amp;rsquo;s documentation, select the first tutorial, and click on the small rocket icon on the top navigation bar. This will launch the tutorial on an online environment that is ready to use.

The current version of NetKet 3.x is described in our recent preprint arXiv:2112.10526.
NetKet 2.x is described in SoftwareX 10, 100311 (2019). Despite many new features, NetKet 3 still builds on the foundations of the NetKet 2 era too. Therefore, we would appreciate it if you cite both papers in order to continue giving credit to all the authors of NetKet 2 as well.</description></item><item><title>NetKet-friendly Summer School in Toulouse</title><link>http://netket.org/posts/02-toulouse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2022 10:23:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>http://netket.org/posts/02-toulouse/</guid><description>We are glad to advertise that our dear colleagues in Toulouse are organising a Summer school in April on Machine Learning techniques for Quantum Many-Body Physics.
