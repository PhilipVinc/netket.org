We are glad to advertise that our dear colleagues in Toulouse are organising a Summer school in April on Machine Learning techniques for Quantum Many-Body Physics.
The school will feature several lectures and tutorials on NetKet.

Below you can find the original announcement.


## Announcement

Toulouse School on Machine Learning for Quantum Many-Body Physics

that will take place in Toulouse, France (4th-8th April 2022). 

The school will take place in hybrid format (with both online and onsite students and lecturers).

This school will be devoted to an introduction to machine learning in quantum many-body physics, supervised / unsupervised / reinforcement learning, various forms of neural networks and their applications in quantum state reconstruction, Variational Monte Carlo, study of ground-state and dynamics of quantum many-body systems etc. 
Lectures by experts will introduce the main concepts and methods, and hands-on tutorials will give the opportunity to put this knowledge into practice.

Confirmed lecturers

 - Giuseppe Carleo (EPF Lausanne)
 - Stefanie Czischek (Waterloo)
 - Mohamed Hibat-Allah (Vector Institute, Toronto & Perimeter Institute, Waterloo) (* online)
 - Florian Marquardt (Max Planck & University of Erlangen-Nuremberg) (* online)
 - Evert van Nieuwenburg (Niels Bohr Institute, Copenhagen)
 - Filippo Vicentini   (EPF Lausanne)
 - More to come ...

Registration is now open (deadline for registration: 8th of March 2022). More information can be found on the following website:

We are very sorry for the late announcement of this school, as the uncertainties caused by the pandemics did not allow easy organisation tasks. 
This school is reloaded from a previously planned version in Spring 2020. 


The organizers: Fabien Alet, Sylvain Capponi
