18 months in development, NetKet 3.0 indicates a major new step for the NetKet project. NetKet has been totally rewritten in Python and is now a Jax-based library. This guarantees outstanding performance while allowing researchers to exploit machine-learning frameworks to define advanced Neural-Networks.

GPUs and Google’s TPUs are now supported too!

Update now and try the new examples!
