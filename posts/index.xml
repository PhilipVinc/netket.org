NetKet has been totally rewritten in Python and is now a Jax-based library. This guarantees outstanding performance while allowing researchers to exploit machine-learning frameworks to define advanced Neural-Networks.
GPUs and Google’s TPUs are now supported too!
Update now and try the new examples!</description></item></channel></rss>
